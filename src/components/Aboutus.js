        <p>*Purpose*:

            To be a leader in the plastic recycling industry by providing enhanced services, relationships and profitability.<br />

            *Vision*: (What happens when you achieve your mission, having all the support and network; the big picture)<br />

            To be in the vanguard of our zero-waste future<br />

            *Mission Statement*:<br />

            Creating a circular economy for Nigeria’s waste using innovative solutions, while promoting sustainable practices through<br />
            an integrated system of waste minimisation, reuse, recycling and consumer education.<br />

            *Pillar*<br />
            De-Rabacon’s current approach is centred on sustainable material management which has a greater impact on resource conservation and mitigating<br />
            the negative effects and not on conventional reuse, recycling, storage and disposal strategy, solving the loop problem currently faced in recycling.<br />
            Using an incentivised model to reclaim plastic wastes from the ocean, and other water bodies and transform them into pavement blocks which are then<br />
            used to make critical infrastructural needs such as roads and flood barriers to mitigate flooding, which has proven to be stable, strong, and in<br />
            combination with bituminous mixes gives a long-lasting pavement performance. This has the potential to absorb hundreds of thousands of tons of plastics<br />
            overnight. These solutions are not without a  plastic waste recovery model, aimed at standardizing the pricing systems within the supply chains of<br />
            plastic waste, and the training of the informal waste sector on waste collection, sorting, and recycling.<br />

            *De-Rabacon Plastics: Leading the Sustainability Revolution*<br />
            In a world facing escalating environmental challenges, De-Rabacon Plastics emerges as a pioneering force, driven by a resolute mission to reshape<br />
            the landscape of pollution reduction, waste management, and sustainable construction. At its core, the essence of De-Rabacon Plastics encapsulates<br />
            a vision of a cleaner, more harmonious world, where innovative solutions catalyze positive change and pave the way for a more sustainable future.<br />

            *Mission and Vision*: De-Rabacon Plastics' mission stands tall – to revolutionize traditional approaches to plastic waste and pollution. With sustainability<br />
            as our compass, we navigate uncharted territories, pioneering a circular economy model that is anchored in innovation, collaboration, and environmental stewardship.<br />
            Our vision extends beyond the immediate horizon, aiming to weave a legacy of reduced pollution, empowered communities, and a thriving circular economy.<br />

            *Theory of Change*: The foundation of De-Rabacon Plastics rests upon a potent Theory of Change. We recognize that plastic pollution is a complex web, stemming from a<br />
            plethora of sources, particularly land-based activities. Through cutting-edge recycling methods and transformative technologies, our theory posits that by repurposing<br />
            plastic waste, we can disrupt the cycle of pollution at its very roots. By diverting plastics from landfills and oceans, we interrupt the trajectory of pollution,<br />
            fostering a significant reduction in its accumulation. This, in turn, paves the way for a profound transformation – one where waste is not a burden, but a valuable resource.<br />


            *Impact Areas*:<br />
            The impact of De-Rabacon Plastics reverberates across multiple dimensions. At its heart, our initiative is a response to the pressing need to combat plastic pollution. By repurposing plastic<br />
            waste through innovative recycling methods, we divert pollutants from entering our oceans and landfills, directly addressing a significant contributor to environmental degradation.<br />
            Our endeavour also intersects with the domain of waste management, as we reconfigure waste materials into valuable resources, bridging the chasm between consumption and conservation.<br />

            Furthermore, De-Rabacon Plastics functions as a powerful agent of change in the realm of sustainable construction. By offering a tangible, eco-friendly alternative, our initiative impacts<br />
            the construction industry, driving a shift towards more environmentally conscious practices. This interconnected approach illustrates the holistic nature of our impact, where pollution reduction,<br />
            waste management, and sustainable construction intersect to foster a resilient, circular economy.<br />


            *Stakeholder Engagement and Multilevel Governance*:<br />
            At the heart of our initiative lies the bedrock of stakeholder engagement and multilevel governance. We recognize that the challenge of plastic pollution cannot be surmounted in isolation.<br />
            By forging dynamic collaborations with local communities, government bodies, and environmental organizations, we amplify our impact exponentially. Through education, empowerment, and shared responsibility,<br />
            we are fostering a collective drive towards sustainable practices. This collaborative ethos also extends to the construction industry, where our engagement with builders, contractors, and homeowners fosters<br />
            a culture of conscious decision-making.<br />
